# Feature Driven Development (FDD)

FDD centers development around small, client-valued features with short, structured iterations. Key practices include:

- Domain Object Modeling
- Developing by Features
- Individual Class (Code) Ownership
- Feature Teams
- Inspections
- Configuration Management
- Regular Builds
- Progress Reporting
