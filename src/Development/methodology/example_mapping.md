### Example Mapping

Clarify user stories and define acceptance criteria through collaborative conversation in BDD.

1. Start with **User Story** on <span style="color: gold;">yellow card</span> - High-level description of a feature from the user's perspective. Placed at the top.
2. Identify **Rules (acceptance criteria)** on <span style="color: blue;">blue cards</span> - Business rules that govern the behavior of the feature. Placed below the user story.
3. Add **Concrete Examples** on <span style="color: green;">green cards</span> - Concrete scenarios illustrating how the feature should behave. Placed below the relevant rule
4. Capture unanswered **Questions** on <span style="color: red;">red cards</span>- Open issues or uncertainties that need resolution to revist later. Parked to the side.
5. Discuss until scope is clear or the time runs out
