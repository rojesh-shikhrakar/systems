# Development

Transforming designs and requirements into functional software through coding, integration, and implementation of best practices. Different software development methodologies provide structured approaches to planning, executing, and managing software projects.

A. Choosing the Software Development Methodology

- Agile (Scrum, Kanban), Waterfall, or a Hybrid approach
- Process adaptation based on company size and project needs

    B. Development Environment Setup

- Version control, integrated development environments (IDEs), and coding standards
- CI/CD pipelines and automated build systems

    C. Implementation Phases

- Modular development (frontend, backend, middleware)
- API development, integration of third-party services, and microservices development
- Code reviews, pair programming, and adherence to best practices
